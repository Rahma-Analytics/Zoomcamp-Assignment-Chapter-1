##Introduction To Data
CASE STUDY: Using stents to prevent strokes

Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful

observations. These observations – collected from the likes of field
notes, surveys, and experiments – form the backbone of a statistical
investigation and are called data. Statistics is the study of how best
to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data, and in this first
chapter, we focus on both the properties of data and on the collection of data.

Stents are devices put inside blood vessels that assist in patient recovery

after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death. Many doctors have
hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the
principal question the researchers hope to answer:
Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?
The researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients.
Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:
Treatment group. Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help
in lifestyle modification.
Control group. Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the
treatment group, but they did not receive stents.

DATA BASICS
Effective organization and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This section
introduces the data matrix for organizing data as well as some terminology about different forms of
data, this organization and description methods include:
Observations, variables, and data matrices.


SAMPLING PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES

Population and sampling:
A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population. In research, a population doesn't always refer to people.
The four types of sampling methods are simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling and multistage sampling methods. 


In statistics, a simple random sample is a subset of individuals chosen from a larger set in which a subset of individuals are chosen randomly, all with the same probability. Is a process of selecting a sample in random way. 

stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a population which can be partitioned into subpopulations.

cluster sampling is a sampling plan used when mutually homogeneous yet internally heterogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population. It is often used in marketing research.

multistage sampling is the taking of samples in stages using smaller and smaller sampling units at each stage.
